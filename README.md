This repository is based on Unsupervised Machine Learning Project.
I have worked on Iris flower dataset , by using K-Mean Clustering approach of Unsupervised ML.
K-Means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms.

It solves the well-known clustering problem.

K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing.

It is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.

This algorithm divides the dataset into K clusters (clusters are divided on the basis of similarity amongst them)

Problem Statement: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. The "Iris.csv" file contains the dataset.

IMPORTANT LIBRARIES: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd from sklearn import datasets from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

CONCLUSION: From the analysis & implementation of K-Means Clustering algorithm i can conclude that for the given Iris dataset "the optimum number of clusters is 3"
